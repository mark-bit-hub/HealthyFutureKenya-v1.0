                <h2>The Multifaceted Health Landscape for Youth in Kenya</h2>
                <p>Youth in Kenya face a range of health issues that significantly impact their well-being and future prospects.
                 Among these, mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety are increasingly prevalent, often exacerbated by economic challenges, social pressures, and limited access to mental health services.
                 Additionally, substance abuse, particularly of alcohol and drugs, poses a serious risk, leading to addiction and related health complications.
                 Infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS, remain a critical concern, with young people being particularly vulnerable due to inadequate sexual health education and limited access to reproductive health services.
                 Furthermore, lifestyle-related issues such as obesity and diabetes are emerging as more youths adopt unhealthy eating habits and sedentary lifestyles.
                 Addressing these multifaceted health challenges requires comprehensive strategies that integrate education, access to healthcare, and community support to promote healthier choices among the youth.

                    <h2>Mental health</h2>
                    <p>Mental health in Kenya is a significant public health issue, with a rising prevalence of mental health disorders.
                        Estimates indicate that around 25% of Kenyans experience mental health issues at some point in their lives.
                        The country faces challenges such as inadequate mental health services, stigma around mental illness, and insufficient funding for mental health programs.
                        The Kenyan government has made some efforts to integrate mental health into primary healthcare but still struggles with resource allocation and awareness.
